### *Written report included*

This project simulates the interactions between gamma rays and a target mass; the photons of the gamma rays scatter off the electrons of the target mass, i.e. demonstrate Compton scattering.

* To run the code and produce the results shown, simply run `main.py` in an activated conda environment.
    - Cesium-137 and barium-133 are present by default, but more can be added in the same format
